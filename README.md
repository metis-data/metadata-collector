# Metis Metadata Collector
Collects metadata from production databases to enrich Metis insights. Connection credentials to the databases are saved using AWS Secretes Manager.

## Deployment
After getting your Metis API Key, login to AWS console and go to
[here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://metis-data-market-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/metadata-collector-cloudformation.yaml&stackName=MetisMetadataCollector)
to create the necessary resources in your cloud environment.

### Minimum IAM Permissions
In order to deploy, your AWS account must have these permissions:
* secretsmanager:CreateSecret
* secretsmanager:PutResourcePolicy
* iam:CreateRole
* ecs:CreateCluster
* ecs:CreateTaskSet
* ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition
* events:PutRule
* ec2:DescribeSubnets
* ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups


### Required Parameters
* **ClusterName** - Your choice of the name of the ECS cluster that will be created.
* **ConnectionStrings** - Connection string to your production database (including the username and password). Multiple connection strings can be given, separated by semicolon (`;`). E.g., `postgresql://postgres:postgres@1.2.3.4/example_db_name_pg;postgresql://user1234:password1234@www.sitename.com/db_name_1234`.
* **MetisAPIKey** - Your API key.
* **SecurityGroupId** - Security group(s) allowing incoming traffic from the Internet and outgoing traffic to the database. The various Security ID Groups are presented as a drop-down menu when clicking on the `SecurityGroupId` field.
* **SubnetId** - Subnet(s) with access to the Internet and to the database. The various Subnet IDs are presented as a drop-down menu when clicking on the `SubnetId` field.

### Created Resources
Clicking `Create stack` will create the following resources in your cloud environment:
* An `ECS cluster` with the name you supplied.
* A `Task Definition` for running the metadata collector.
* An `EventBridge` trigger that runs the task every hour.
* Two `IAM` roles.
* A secret in `AWS Secrets Manager`, storing the connection string(s) to the database.

## Troubleshooting
* If everything runs successfully, you should be able to see logs in the Metis webapp within an hour.
* If you don't see any logs, but the AWS tasks are able to run, their logs can be found in `AWS CloudWatch` under a log group named `ecs/<cluster_name>`, where `<cluster_name>` is the name of the cluster chosen by the user in the stack parameters.
* If the log group doesn’t exist, it could be that the task was started but unable to run. If that is the problem, the task will be visible in the cluster under the `Tasks` tab with `Desired task status: Stopped`. Clicking on it will open a page that shows the `Stopped reason`.
  * A common reason is the task was unable to pull the docker image, because the security group doesn’t allow outbound access to the internet.
* If no task appears in the cluster, it probably was unable to start. In that case, logs of the task’s trigger can be found in `AWS CloudTrail` with the event name `RunTask`.
  * A common reason is choosing a security group that doesn’t belong to the VPC of the chosen subnets.

## Sent Data
The collector sends to Metis Data only logs that describes the running of the collection and metadata, such as:
* Number of rows per table.
* Indexes size.
* Index usage per index.
